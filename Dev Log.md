Week 1:

Project proposal and team contract were written and submitted.

Project proposal was rejected. A new dataset was selected and the project proposal
was rewritten and submitted. Approved on Thursday, 18.Nov.21. Work began on Friday
though not much was accomplished due to travel for the holiday break.

Week 3:

Fall break

Week 4:

Sean Womack: Dev log for weeks 1-3 completed and uploaded.

Sean Womack: Data import completed. Data is read in from a CSV line-by-line into a
vector of strings. Each element is then split on itâ€™s comma and loaded into a class
that stores the named information in the dataset (airport name, latitude and longitude,
city and country, etc.). The strings are split with a function that mimics that of
python string split using a delimiter.

Alan Cardiel: Graph building

Sasha Bilenkyi: Start working on the final presentation slides. 

Justin Gharib: BFS search/Shortest path
