Project Poposal sarobin2-acard6-ob5-jgharib2

Leading question:

    Given a set of known flight paths we want to be able to:

        -Find the shortest path between two chosen points
        -highlight all the shortest paths
        -Output that path onto a world map

Dataset Acquisition and Processing:

<<<<<<< HEAD
    Acquisition:

        For out dataset we will be using OpenFlights (https://openflights.org/data.html) mainly focusing on the route path data. This data will lead our verticies to be airports/stops made and the edges to be the flight path between 

    Processing:

        In terms of processing the dataset we will download the data file (.CSV) contating the flight paths from the OpenFlighst dataset stoting the data in an adjacency list for optimal runtime. From this list we will determine the optimal route from a chosen  point to another.

Graph Algorithms:

    Data Algorithms:

        Shortest path - Develop an algorithm that will find the shortest path between two given points in the set using Dijkstra's and Floydâ€“Warshall algorithms for comparison. The Input would be a set of flight paths and the output would be all possible shortest paths between the chosen two points. The expected runtime of this algoritm is
        
        Graph coloring - Develop an algorithm that colors the edges of the output such that the shortest path is highlighted and every other path is colored by determing how much of an increase it is from the shortest path by a given tolerence. Input will be a set of flight paths, and the output would be a graph with edges colored to visualize the optimal paths. The expected runtime of this graph coloring algorithm is O(V^2+E).

        Rendering - If time alloted, develop an algorithm that outputs the colored graph onto a world map. The input would be the colored shortest path graph and the list of associated airports. The expected runtime would be O(deg(V))

    Traversal Algorithms:
    
        The main travelral algorithm will be a Breadth-first search. Where the input would be  a the set of flight paths and the output would find the spanning set from one point to another. The output will also have appropriated edge coloring representing the shortest path between two chosen points. The expected runtime of a BFS traversal sould be O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

Timeline:

    Week 1: Data collection and process
        Complete and submit the team contract and initial project proposal. No real work can be done till project is approved.
 
<<<<<<< HEAD
    Week 2: Revision and shortest path algorithm
       	Team members will tackle the revising the proposal to better fit the project and develop the shortest path algorithms. The first issue will be to address the corrections needed to make to the proposal to move the project forward. After that, tasks can be split between processing data to make a graph via BFS traveral and a shortest path algorithm.
=======
    Week 2: Revision and 
       	Team members will tackle the development of the shortest route algorithms and graph coloring algorithms. 
>>>>>>> 54c67e2385935efcac85074c3e25b4e81979db8d
 
    Week 3: Off (Fall break)
 
    Week 4: Graph coloring and rendering
       	The graph coloring algorithm and rendering will be implemented once the overall structure of the graph is completed. Team members will also write test cases to thoroughly test the code in various aspects. Past tests will be improved upon and cleaned.
 
    Week 5: Zazz
       	Polish off any components and add face lighting if time is available.
