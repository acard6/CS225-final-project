#### Week 1:

Project proposal and team contract were written and submitted.

#### Week 2:

Project proposal was rejected. A new dataset was selected and the project proposal
was rewritten and submitted. Approved on Thursday, 18.Nov.21. Work began on Friday
though not much was accomplished due to travel for the holiday break.

#### Week 3:

Fall break

#### Week 4:

Sean Womack: Dev log for weeks 1-3 completed and uploaded.

Sean Womack: Data import completed. Data is read in from a CSV line-by-line into a
vector of strings. Each element is then split on itâ€™s comma and loaded into a class
that stores the named information in the dataset (airport name, latitude and longitude,
city and country, etc.). The strings are split with a function that mimics that of
python string split using a delimiter.

Alan Cardiel: Laid out the basic ground work for wha the graph data structure would contain
along with some functions and variables. The first function completed was calculating the
distance between 2 points using havsine function.

#### Week 5:

Sasha Bilenkyi: Start working on the final presentation slides. 

Justin Gharib: BFS search/Shortest path

Sean Womack: Rendering, Dev Log, README, Graph coloring

Alan Cardiel: implemented the remainder of the graph data structure and tested out result on
a small scale
