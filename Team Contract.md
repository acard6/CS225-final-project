Team Contract (ob5, sarobin2, acard6, jgharib2)


Communication:
1. Team Meetings: Team meetings will be held weekly on Sunday and Wednesday at 1600 with the exception of Fall break. Should the day or time need to change, that must be communicated at least two days prior to the new date. The meetings will be conducted via Discord in either text or voice chat. Notes will be taken alongside the meeting and posted and pinned in the “Notes” channel in the team server. The note taker will be the host of the meeting. The host will rotate each week starting with sarobin2.
2. Assistance: Assistance can be requested in the team server in the “General” channel. Excluding extraordinary circumstances, response time should be within 48 hours.
3. Respect: Once team meetings have begun and the overview has been presented, each team member will be allotted time to discuss their current task progress and any difficulties they have encountered or anticipate. They will then be allowed to express opinions or ask questions about other tasks in the project.


Collaboration:
1. Work Distribution: Tasks will be written up each week and distributed at the weekly meeting. Each team member may volunteer for any task they wish. If a task is unassigned and each member has roughly the same amount of tasks, the unassigned task will be split evenly amongst all members. Otherwise, it will be assigned to the one with the least workload. As such, whoever it is assigned to is encouraged to ask for assistance as much as possible from anyone.
2. Time Commitment: Time each week should average about five hours. Should a team member find that they are going well over this, they are encouraged to ask for help at any time, but during the meetings is recommended. Should a team member find that they are under this time, they should reach out in the discord server and ask if any other member needs help with their tasks.
3. Conflict Resolution: Decisions will be made via the democratic process. Each team member will cast their vote, and the majority will win. Should a tie arise, it will be decided by a coin flip via Google coin flip (shorturl.at/jkwK8).
